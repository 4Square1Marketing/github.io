<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4Square1 is the App for all car sales professionals and commercial customers. It delivers the freedom to negotiate deals and deliver quotes based on real time customer interactions which builds credibility and rapport.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What turns shoppers into buyers? Information. Statistics show that most customers show up at a dealership when they are ready to buy. What customers want is information on how much the car they researched is going to cost and what are the payment options available to them. Studies show that the longer the sales process the more likely the customer will grade the experience negatively, or worse decline to buy the vehicle. 4Square1 cuts the “back and forth” of price negotiations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4Square1 is also the perfect sales aid for commercial buyers. This allows the commercial buyer to explore pricing, incentives and deal structure without the necessity of a face to face meeting. Business transactions that previously took three or four hours are now completed with the convenience of a phone call.<br>
