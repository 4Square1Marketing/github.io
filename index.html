<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4Square1 is the App for all car sales professionals and consumers. It delivers the freedom to negotiate deals and deliver quotes based on real time customer interactions building credibility and rapport.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What turns shoppers into buyers? Information. Statistics show that most customers show up at a dealership when they are ready to buy. What customers want is information on how much the car they researched is going to cost them and what are the payment options available to them. Studies show that the longer the sales process the more likely the customer will grade the experience negatively, or worse decline to buy the vehicle. 4Square1 cuts the “back and forth” of price negotiations by over fifty percent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4Square1 is also the perfect sales aid for buyers. Unfortunately <i>caveat emptor</i> is still necessary no matter what is being purchased and 4Square1 provides the consumer with information on the most important part of the transaction: payment.</span></p>
